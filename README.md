üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Data Flow
This project follows a classic MERN-like stack architecture (without React) where a Vanilla JS frontend communicates with a backend RESTful API.

High-Level Data Flow:
User Interaction -> Frontend (index.html) -> API Call -> Express Backend -> Business Logic -> MongoDB / NewsAPI

Key System Logic:
News Caching System:

When a user requests news, the backend first checks its MongoDB articles collection for fresh (non-expired) cached data.
Cache Hit: If found, it serves the articles directly from the database, which is extremely fast.
Cache Miss: If not found (or expired), it fetches data from the external NewsAPI.ai, saves the new articles to the database with a 2-hour expiry, and then serves them to the user.
A background job runs hourly to clean up expired articles, keeping the database efficient.
Persistent Reaction System:

Each user reaction is a document in the reactions collection, linking a user, an articleId, and a reactionType.
A compound unique index on { user, articleId } ensures one user can only have one reaction per article.
When a user reacts, the backend creates or updates their specific reaction document.
It then uses a MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline to recalculate the total counts (likes, dislikes, neutral) for that article across all users and returns the new totals.
The frontend updates the UI in real-time with the new counts.
üöÄ Getting Started Locally
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (v18.x or higher)
npm (comes with Node.js)
MongoDB (or a MongoDB Atlas account)
2. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/NewsPulse.git
cd NewsPulse
3. Install Dependencies
Bash

npm install
4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project and add the following variables.

env

# .env.example

# Server Port
PORT=5000

# MongoDB Connection String
# For local MongoDB:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/newspulse
# For MongoDB Atlas (replace with your string):
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/newspulse?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT Configuration
# Generate a strong secret with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_that_is_very_long_and_random
JWT_EXPIRE=7d

# External API Key
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_ai_key_here
5. Run the Application
Bash

# Start the server (with hot-reloading using nodemon)
npm run dev

# Or for production mode:
npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:5000.
